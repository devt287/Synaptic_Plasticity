Research project with Prof.McLaughlin and Guanchun Li: 
&NewLine;This project is be to study, theoretically and computationally, the behavior of several mathematical models of a type of synaptic plasticity known as long term potentiation/depression (LTP/D).  Synaptic underlies how cortical systems of neurons develop (from before birth to adulthood) and learn.  This type of learning is also called "unsupervised learning".
We will be investigating two distinct subtypes of LTP/D -- "spike timing dependent plasticity" (STDP) and "behavioral time scale plasticity" (BTSP).  These two subtypes act over very different time scales -- 10s of ms for STDP, a few seconds for BTSP.  The second (BTSP) is thought to play an important role in "one-shot learning", an example of  which is mice hippocampal neurons ("place cells") that learn spatial location with only one or two passes across a particular "place".
