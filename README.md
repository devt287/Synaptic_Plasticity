Research project with Prof.McLaughlin and Guanchun Li: 

This project is be to study, theoretically and computationally, the behavior of several mathematical models of a type of synaptic plasticity known as long term potentiation/depression (LTP/D). We will be investigating two distinct subtypes of LTP/D -- "spike timing dependent plasticity" (STDP) and "behavioral time scale plasticity" (BTSP). ".
